# Session 79: Whispers Amongst the Leaves

**Location**: The Enchanted Grove  
**Date**: 6/7/2025, 8:16:41 PM

## Summary
The wind whispers through the Enchanted Grove as your party treads carefully along the ancient path, flanked by towering trees whose leaves shimmer like emeralds under the dappled sunlight. The air feels alive, tinged with an otherworldly essence that sends shivers down your spine. Elowen, the druid, stands at the forefront, her hand gently caressing the bark of a nearby tree, seemingly drawing strength from its immense age.

Suddenly, the tranquility of the grove shatters as the ground beneath you trembles, roots writhing and twisting to life. From the foliage ahead emerges a creature woven from the very fibers of the forest, a guardian of old known as a Treant. Its eyes, glowing with the light of ancient wisdom, lock onto you, silently questioning your purpose in its sacred wood.

"Be warned," Elowen cautions, her voice carrying a weight of respect. "The grove's guardians test those who enter. Show them you mean no harm, or they will show you the strength of the forest."

The Treant's branches stretch towards you, not in threat, but in a gesture of eerie expectancy. It seems to wait for your next move, its timeless patience a stark reminder of your fleeting mortality.
