Session 1: Awakening Dreads: The Gathering at Elderglen Square
Elderglen Village Square
The air carries a crisp chill, hinting at the end of a long summer as the sun begins its descent beyond the horizon. In the heart of Elderglen, a village lined with cobblestone paths and modest cottages, the townsfolk gather in the central square. Vibrant banners from the recent harvest festival still flutter overhead, adding a stark contrast to the worry etched on each face. Mayor Elden Beswick, a portly man with a warm demeanor now clouded by concern, addresses the crowd from atop a wooden platform.

'Friends of Elderglen,' he begins, his voice straining to mask the growing dread, 'I fear the tales of old may be waking. The curse of Elderglen, spoken of only in hushed whispers, is stirring. Our crops wither without warning, livestock vanish, and an ominous fog creeps closer every night.' His words hang heavy in the evening air, eliciting quiet murmurs among the villagers.

A softly rolling mist begins to creep around the edges of the square, like grasping fingers seeking purchase. The adventurers, finding themselves amidst this gathering—whether by chance or fate—sense a call to action. Mayor Beswick looks to them, desperation shining through hopeful eyes, and pleads, 'Brave souls, will you uncover the truths we so desperately need? Lend us your courage and perhaps, just perhaps, we shall stave off this cursed fate.'

Beneath the murmurs and uncertain glances of the townsfolk, an unspoken promise hangs in the air. A promise that amidst ancient curses and the shadows they bring, heroes rise to meet the challenge. The adventure begins here, in Elderglen, where darkness and destiny entwine.


Session 2: Whispers of the Ancients
The village of Elderglen, near an ancient tower.
The quaint village of Elderglen, nestled amid towering pines, seems peaceful at first glance, but an unsettling aura lingers in the air. As the party steps onto the cobblestone path leading into the heart of the village, they notice the villagers darting quick, furtive glances at them before hastily returning to their chores. A dense fog rolls in from the surrounding forest, shrouding the village in an ethereal glow, whispering hidden truths and ancient secrets to those willing to listen carefully.

A villager, an elderly woman with a complexion reminiscent of withered parchment, approaches tentatively. Her voice trembles as she speaks, 'You must be the ones the elders spoke of. The curse... it's waking. Please, seek out the sage at the old tower. He knows things...dangerous things.' Her frail hands shake as she points towards an ancient structure barely visible through the encroaching mist to the north.

The party makes their way through the village, each step echoed by the muted cries of distant, unseen crows. The path is lined with croft houses with thatched roofs, chimneys puffing weak tendrils of smoke. As they near the ancient tower, overgrown with twisting vines and ivy, they catch sight of faint runes etched into the stones of its foundation, glowing with a soft, ominous light.

Suddenly, an apparition flares to life atop the tower, a flicker of ghostly blue illuminating the surrounding night. It gestures wildly, as if trying to communicate, but its words are indistinct, drowned by the howling wind. The energy in the air crackles with expectancy, offering choices that will shape the very fate of Elderglen.
