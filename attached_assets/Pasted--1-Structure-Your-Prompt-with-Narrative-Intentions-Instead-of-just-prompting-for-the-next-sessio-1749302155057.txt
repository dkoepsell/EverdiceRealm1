🧠 1. Structure Your Prompt with Narrative Intentions
Instead of just prompting for "the next session," structure your prompt to tell the model what you want:

text
Copy
Edit
You are a Dungeons & Dragons storyteller generating an adventure session.

Session Summary:
- Current location: Enchanted Grove, Heartwood Clearing
- Party members: Thorne Ironfist (fighter), Elowen (druid), others
- Current tension: Mysterious mist corrupting the grove
- Last event: Shadow Wolf encountered, gateway to the grove's heart revealed

Instructions:
1. Begin with a vivid description of the environment.
2. Include a dramatic development or encounter that pushes the story forward.
3. Offer 2–3 meaningful player choices or tests (combat, wisdom, stealth, etc.).
4. Ensure continuity with past events and character motivations.
5. Include character-specific interactions if relevant (e.g., Elowen’s lore, Thorne’s distrust of magic).

Now generate Session 74 of the narrative.
Use system messages (if using GPT-4-turbo) to lock in tone, style, and world logic.

⚙️ 2. Add Session Memory or History
Inject a compact summary of prior sessions into the prompt:

Copy
Edit
Session Memory:
- The forest is becoming corrupted by unnatural mist.
- Elowen believes the balance of the grove is in danger.
- Players encountered a Shadow Wolf and discovered an ancient archway.
- A Guardian now tests their worth.
You can save and pass these in a structured format (e.g., JSON, markdown) or as part of a hidden context field if you're using the API programmatically.

🪢 3. Design for Choices and Branching Outcomes
Rather than leaving choices ambiguous, define their shape ahead of time:

Edit
Choice Structure:
- [Combat]: Confront the Guardian directly.
- [Diplomacy]: Attempt to commune with the Guardian via Elowen’s magic.
- [Cunning]: Seek a hidden path around the encounter using stealth or knowledge of the runes.
You can also instruct the model to return:

{
  "scene_description": "...",
  "choices": [
    { "label": "Confront the Guardian", "consequence": "Combat encounter begins" },
    { "label": "Speak through Elowen", "consequence": "Gain insight into the grove's pain" },
    { "label": "Search for another way", "consequence": "Risk stealth check to bypass" }
  ]
}
This format makes it easy to track player choices and ensure consequences are handled logically in the next call.

🧩 4. Prompt Engineering Templates for Better Coherence
Here's a reusable prompt template you can adapt per session:

text
Copy
Edit
SYSTEM:
You are a fantasy adventure narrator for a D&D campaign. Maintain rich sensory detail, character consistency, and meaningful branching. Keep pacing tight and tie each session to prior ones. Assume a persistent world with memory.

USER:
Generate the next session in a D&D campaign. The players are deep in the Enchanted Grove, where a spreading magical corruption has awakened ancient guardians. Elowen the druid is guiding them. In the last session, the party stood before a mystical archway guarded by a spectral stone face demanding proof of worth.

Your goal:
1. Build tension with a sensory-rich opening.
2. Introduce an event that requires the party to act (e.g., trial, encounter, clue).
3. Present at least three clear narrative choices with logical consequences.
4. Include dialogue from Elowen or Thorne if appropriate.
5. End on a cliffhanger or outcome tied to the chosen path.
🧰 5. Tools and Tricks for Narrative Momentum
Avoid repeating scenery intros – carry forward unresolved action.

Use verbs of change – show how the world shifts in reaction to players.

Foreshadow – let encounters point toward something bigger.

Tag subplots – e.g., "Elowen seems changed by what she sensed here..."

🔁 Optional: GPT-driven Scene Planner
If you want structured generation:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "session_number": 74,
  "location": "Ancient Grove Archway",
  "encounter_type": "Moral Trial + Environmental Puzzle",
  "narrative_function": "Test character motivations and loyalty to the grove",
  "outcomes": {
    "combat": "Guardian defends the sacred grove",
    "diplomacy": "Vision of the grove's ancient pact is granted",
    "stealth": "Find a side path leading to a corrupted glade"
  }
}
Pass this JSON into your prompt and ask GPT to "Write a narrative session based on this scene plan."
